## TASK MANAGER
In the Task Manager application, the first user must register. Since the username is unique, it ensures that users are authorized to access their own tasks. For operations such as creating, updating, and deleting tasks, the username provided in the Basic Authentication must match the username associated with the request. This prevents users from accessing each other's resources.

With Basic Authentication in place, if a user tries to access records belonging to another user, the request will be denied. Both the username used in Basic Authentication and the username associated with the task must match for the operation to succeed.
